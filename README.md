# byte-code
In byte_code.txt file, I have mentioned how exactly we can display bytecode of any python source code. 
For the sake of python source code - I have considered a simple program to reverse letters os a word and not the entire string.

Installation 
- Python interpreter

Running the command 

python -m dis reverse.py

dis : - disassembler (displays bytecode in an understandable format)
